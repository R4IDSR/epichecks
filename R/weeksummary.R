#' Create an excel summary report of data submitted for week by each country.
#'
#' @param x A data frame of IDSR data which has been created from {aggregator}
#' @param current_year The year of interest as numeric (e.g. the default is 2020)
#' @param current_week The week of interest as numeric. The default is 1.
#' Values less than 10 are padded with leading zeros, e.g. 1 becomes 01. (You
#' could also enter 01 and it would be fine)
#' @param output_path File path where you would like outputs to be saved to.
#' Within this folder a new folder will be created and named after the current week.
#' This defaults to your current directory, with subfolders of data > outputs > verification.
#' The year folder needs to exist already - only the current week folder will be created.
