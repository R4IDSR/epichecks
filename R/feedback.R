#' Create excel sheets with feedback for countries. Returns an excel workbook
#' for each country with one sheet showing missings and another showing threshold
#' flags, as well as recommendations for each.
#' Requires WHO IDSR data which has been prepared using the {clean_idsr} function,
#' and then run through the {missing_checker} and {threshold_checker} functions,
#' and all being stored in a list with a data frame for each country.
#'
#' @param x A list of data frames which has been processed with {clean_idsr},
#'  {missing_checker} and {threshold_checker}.
#' @param current_year The year of interest as numeric (e.g. the default is 2020)
#' @param current_week The week of interest as numeric. The default is 1.
#' Values less than 10 are padded with leading zeros, e.g. 1 becomes 01. (You
#' could also enter 01 and it would be fine)
#' @param output_path File path where you would like outputs to be saved to.
#' Within this folder a new folder will be created and named after the current week.
#' This defaults to your current directory, with subfolders of data > outputs > verification.
#' The year folder needs to exist already - only the current week folder will be created.
