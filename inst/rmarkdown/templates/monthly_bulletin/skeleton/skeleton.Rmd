/// define current month \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This section is used to define your month of interest. It will be used later
to filter your outputs. 
You can also set the day which your epiweek starts on - the default for this
is Monday. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

```{r define_current_month, echo = FALSE}

## set the day that defines the beginning of your epiweek.
aweek::set_week_start("Monday")

## set starting week for the month
start_week <- aweek::as.aweek("2018-W01")

## set the ending week 
end_week <- aweek::as.aweek("2018-W05")

## pull together all weeks of interest 
current_weeks <- aweek::factor_aweek(
  c(start_week,
    end_week)
  )
```



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// setup \\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Several packages are required for different aspects of  analysis with *R*. 
You will need to install these before starting. 

These packages can be quite large and may take a while to download in the
field. If you have access to a USB key with these packages, it makes sense to
copy and paste the packages into your computer's R package library 
(run the command .libPaths() to see the folder path). 

For help installing packages, please visit https://r4epis.netlify.com/welcome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## set the chunks of code to not show up in output
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

## Installing required packages for this template
required_packages <- c("here",       # define pathways to files
                       "rio",     # import datasets

                       "knitr",   # for cleaner tables
                       "epichecks" # for WHO IDSR functions

  }
```



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// read_data \\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 This section will read in the all csv files placed in folders for the weeks of 
 interest. 
 It will then do some data cleaning and simplify the names of datasets. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

```{r read_data}

## file path where IDSR processed data is
input_path <- here::here("Data", "Processed")

## get paths of all the files in weeks of interest folders with .csv file format
file_paths <- Sys.glob(str_glue("{input_path}/{levels(current_weeks)}/*.csv"))

## import each excel file individually saved in a list
## do not bind them together imediately
processed_data <- import_list(file_paths, rbind = FALSE, na = "NULL")


## apply cleaning steps to each country dataset in list
processed_data <- purrr::map(processed_data, clean_data)

## pull country name from first row of country variable
cleaned_names <- purrr::map_chr(purrr::map(processed_data, "country"), 1L)

## overwrite names in processed_data to be simplified country names
names(processed_data) <- cleaned_names
```


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// flag_data \\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 This section will create flags for missings and thresholds in the datasets. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

```{r flag_data}
## run missing_checker over each dataset in list to flag missing counts
processed_data <- purrr::map(processed_data, missing_checker)
## run threshold_checker over each dataset in list to flag high counts
processed_data <- purrr::map(processed_data, threshold_checker)
```


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// aggregate_data \\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 This section will aggregate all datasets from the list in to one data frame. 
 It will then filter for the weeks of interest. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

```{r aggregate_data}

## run aggregator function to pull together a merged dataset
processed_data_agg <- aggregator(processed_data, output_path = NULL)

## filter for weeks of interest 
processed_data_agg <- filter(processed_data_agg, 
                             epiweek >= start_week, 
                             epiweek <= end_week)
```


# I- Introduction notes 
The International Health Regulations (IHR), adopted in 2005, state that each 
country shall strengthen and maintain the capacity to detect, assess, and respond
to all events that may constitute public health emergencies of international 
concern (PHEICs) and report them to the World Health Organization (WHO).  
In the African Region, the IHR priorities are being achieved through the 
implementation of the Integrated Disease Surveillance (IDSR) adopted by Member 
States in 1998.  
The IDSR strategy aims to develop and implement comprehensive surveillance and 
response systems with the aim of building capacities for early detection and 
timely responses to major public health events. As per their IHR obligations and
IDSR commitments, Member States submit to the WHO regional Office for Africa, 
on a weekly basis, reports on diseases and conditions under surveillance.  
These reports are collated at the WHO regional office to provide an overview on 
the status of diseases and conditions under surveillance in the region and to 
analyze events that may traverse international boundaries. The current bulletin 
synthetizes the completeness and timeliness of reporting as well as the results 
of alert threshold analyses for diseases and conditions under surveillance in 
the WHO African region. The analyses included in this bulletin are strictly based
on data reported by Member States as a result of the implementation of the IDSR,
which are limited to suspect cases and deaths. This bulletin also provides an 
overview of outbreaks and other public health emergencies ongoing in the African 
region as per the end of the month of publication. This bulletin focuses in 
epidemiological analysis and does not provide any information on responses to 
ongoing events in the WHO African region.
