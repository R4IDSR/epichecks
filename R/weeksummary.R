#' Create an excel summary report of data submitted for week by each country.
#'
#' @param x A data frame of IDSR data which has been created from {aggregator}
#' @param current_week The week of interest as a character or {aweek} object.
#' Needs to be in the correct format ("YYYY-Www").
#' The default "2018-W35" is just to demonstrate the necessary format.
#' @param output_path File path where you would like outputs to be saved to.
#' Within this folder a new folder will be created and named after the current week.
#' This defaults to your current directory, with subfolders of data > outputs > verification.
#' These folders need to exist already - only the current week folder will be created.
#' The file itself will labelled with the current week, e.g. "SummaryReport_2018-w35.xlsx"
