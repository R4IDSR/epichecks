This section is used to define your month of interest. It will be used later
to filter your outputs. 
You can also set the day which your epiweek starts on - the default for this
is Monday. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

```{r define_current_month, echo = FALSE}

## set the day that defines the beginning of your epiweek.
aweek::set_week_start("Monday")

## set starting week for the month
start_week <- aweek::as.aweek("2018-W01")

## set the ending week 
end_week <- aweek::as.aweek("2018-W05")
```



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// setup \\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Several packages are required for different aspects of  analysis with *R*. 
You will need to install these before starting. 

These packages can be quite large and may take a while to download in the
field. If you have access to a USB key with these packages, it makes sense to
copy and paste the packages into your computer's R package library 
(run the command .libPaths() to see the folder path).

# I- Introduction notes 
The International Health Regulations (IHR), adopted in 2005, state that each 
country shall strengthen and maintain the capacity to detect, assess, and respond
to all events that may constitute public health emergencies of international 
concern (PHEICs) and report them to the World Health Organization (WHO).  
In the African Region, the IHR priorities are being achieved through the 
implementation of the Integrated Disease Surveillance (IDSR) adopted by Member 
States in 1998.  
The IDSR strategy aims to develop and implement comprehensive surveillance and 
response systems with the aim of building capacities for early detection and 
timely responses to major public health events. As per their IHR obligations and
IDSR commitments, Member States submit to the WHO regional Office for Africa, 
on a weekly basis, reports on diseases and conditions under surveillance.  
These reports are collated at the WHO regional office to provide an overview on 
the status of diseases and conditions under surveillance in the region and to 
analyze events that may traverse international boundaries. The current bulletin 
synthetizes the completeness and timeliness of reporting as well as the results 
of alert threshold analyses for diseases and conditions under surveillance in 
the WHO African region. The analyses included in this bulletin are strictly based
on data reported by Member States as a result of the implementation of the IDSR,
which are limited to suspect cases and deaths. This bulletin also provides an 
overview of outbreaks and other public health emergencies ongoing in the African 
region as per the end of the month of publication. This bulletin focuses in 
epidemiological analysis and does not provide any information on responses to 
ongoing events in the WHO African region.
